## Dataset

The data consisted of data on 183,412 bikes. The features incuded the duration sec, start time, end time, start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude, bike id, user type, member birth year, member gender, bike share for all trip. One row was removed from the data for inconsistent information.

The dataset can be found in the udacity data library [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38-201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv),

## Summary of Findings

In the exporation, I discovered that usertypes was not as significant as 

user gender in the nasture of usage and relationship. The user type 

did little or nothing to affect bike sharing, distance or duration. Rather,

the user gender was a significant factor that influenced

these other factors. "Other"gender spent more time and covered more distance 

during usage than other genders. The distance covered also did not affect the 

choice of either the subscibers or customers to share their bikes. Not sharing 

their bikes was a popular option among the user. As expected, the relationshop 

between the age and distance is pretty normal, with old users spending less time. 

Although a few surprising age ranges were discovered in the dataset.

My discovery that one of the main variable of interest affected little in the dataset

did not stop me from exploring all the relationships available.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I paid attention to only the relationship between distance, 

gender and duration. I wrangled my dataset and then introduced a new column - 

"Distance" which would be critical to my presentation and then I went on to introduce 

gender, distane and duration. 

I then went on to explore the relationship between distance and duration and gender.

I made use of a scatter plot, selecting 500 samples to get a cleaner result.
